# crud-students
This project is about my course when I was taught by Ot√°vio Miranda.

I made this project in English to pratice my english because I'm from Brazil.

This project contains React, axios, react-router-dom in the front-end. The back-end contains Sequelize, Express, dotenv, and bcrypt.
It's for registering and logging in new users, as well as for adding student data and photos.

npm start - React deploy.
npm run dev - Beck-end deploy.
